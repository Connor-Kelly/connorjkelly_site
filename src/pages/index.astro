		I write code and build things. Currently, I am a senior @ Rice
		University studying Computer Science, and I plan to work in Software
		Engineering after I graduate. Currently, I spend my time working on my
		admittedly excessive courseload, drawing, and exploring the various
		curiosities of Houston.

	<p>
		I've most of my life learning, and acquiring interesting stories, And
		someone once told me to write some of them down. So, that's my plan
		here: write down the projects that I use, the lessons I learn, and maybe
		a story or two.

		Navigating the site should be pretty easy, the nav at the top should be
		self explanatory, feel free to explore, but please remember: I'm
		building this site in my freetime from a 19 credit hour courseload at a
		t20 stem program, there will be bugs.

		 about them if you have the time!
