## Why
The purpose of this site is to learn more about web development, specifically in the frontend.
This site also helps me fill in that box in recuitment where they ask for your website,
so, if you are here from that link specifically, please feel free to interview me,
accept, and pay me lots of money.

## How
This also makes it simpler for me to deploy. I'm educating myself on this topic,
so simplicity is key. My real goal is to build a rich site that I can resonably 
upkeep on my own.

To assist with that, the site is run by Astro, which allows me to build components in 
React, Vue, Svelte, or just HTML. This means I can learn the ins and outs of the frontend framework
without setting up and working with projects for each framework.
