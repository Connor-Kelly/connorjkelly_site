## The Workhorse

Keychron keyboards are just great. For the quality of keyboard you get, 
they're damn cheap. The pro board that I have comes with Gateron Reds,
QMK / VIA, and Bluetooth. Its got an aluminum case and double shot PBT keycaps.
I don't know what more praise I can give it other than the fact that
I wish I wouldn't have bought it, solely because it was the reason that I became more
interested in keyboards.

Effectively, this is the perfect keyboard, anything else you need from a keyboard 
comes from extenuating personal preference.

The only place you go from here is also something special. Here are the routes that 
you can go from here:
- Clicky
- Ortholinear
- Split

For literally anything else, you're spending a massive amount of money for something
that may be a minimal margin better than this. 

That's why, from here, I went to an Ortholinear, Split keyboard.
