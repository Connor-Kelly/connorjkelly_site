## Learning to config:

One of the most important things you learn in software development is how you
keep up with all the things you keep configured. Linux is a similar setup, but 
100x'ed. Depending on the distro, you may be able to configure everything from 
hard drive mount points to the color of primary buttons in all the GTK applications
in the system. So, learning to keep up your configurations can be super important.

In most cases, your config is gonna be in 4 or 5 different markup languages. For reference,
a quick look at my configs have these types: .ini, .json, .toml, .css, .lua, .yml, .conf, 
.xml, .py, and a lisp or two. It all depends on what you're using, but for the most part,
need to learn two things: how to look up the docs for your software, and how to quickly
learn how to read and write different languages.
