## Why learn anything other than Java and Javascript

If you learn Java and JS, you can get a job basically anywhere.
Everything else, whether that be something useful like Python or SQL,
or something fun like Rust or Elixir. Everything else is extra. 

But, for some reason, I fucking hate Java. I like Javascript purely for the
entirely unhinged JS I've learned to read and write. I think PHP is for 
complete fucking morons, and python makes me debate the benefits 
of toaster bathes.

Sometimes, I just want to write some insane, cursed shit that most people 
would take one look at and say "thats not for me." Other times, I want to 
write some code that is simple, elegant, and beautiful; the kind of code that
feels like painting your own personal masterpiece. To find experiences like 
that, you can't just write Java. 

## The Pursuit of an Interesting Challenge

The purpose of the challenge is not the challenge itself, but the things 
you learn along the way.
