## Baby Rack

So servers are cool right. And not just servers, but server racks are cool too. 

Whats cool about them is the functionality of the them. They're intended to be designed 
for industrial use. For simple exchange. They're meant to be worked on, and pulled out, 
and replaced.

And there's a standard. 

But, server racks are also big, expensive, clunky and loud. Let's just imagine instead that, 
the rack was half the size. Now, we have a cool design, with modularity, but we don't 
mind throwing it on a desktop rather than in its own room. 

And dammit if it isn't super cute.

Come on, just look at these things!

The best part, these things are 10in. Which means that they're just small enough that you can fit 
a rack unit on a 3d printer. That's a big win, because theres not good support for little racks like
these. You want a custom setup for your 4 raspberry pis, go for it. Want a custom hookup for a 1u 
network and usb-c power supply unit, make it yourself. Wanna fit a mini-itx motherboard in and 
turn the little rack into your own little rack PC? Carteblanche, but I'd might go for the metal
one that GeeekPi sells on amazon, but some PETG-Plus and some thicker tolerances, it should hold up.

It's the kind of thing that hackers and builders really like. Its just kinda fun. 

Things like this should be fun.
