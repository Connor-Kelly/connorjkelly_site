## Starting hardware

My main server is this Zimaboard 8Gb: 

!Zimaboard image

Basically, its a badass raspberry pi, but its x86, has sata ports, dual NIC and an Intel N100. 
Its super cool as an idea, and I bought one a while back for a nas, but never got it set up
properly.

My main plan is to jam this thing in the bbrack and stick it on a few big drives, though for now,
its gonna be the main server for a few docker containers and a minecraft server.

## OS

Theres a few options for OS's that I looked at: 
- Debian
- NixOS
- UbuntuServer
- CasaOS

### Debian
Kinda the gold standard for linux servers. When people talk about a linux server that hasn't been
shut down for more than a decade, its usually an old debian server. I'm assuming theres a reason why,
but I don't know
