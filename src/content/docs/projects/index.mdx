### What is this:

The projects documented here are the projects I both deemed interesting enough 
to write down, as well as good enough that someone might think that it might be an 
interesting read.

Please feel free to read through any of the pages here, but keep in mind that I do
all this after work, and often, documenting the work is the most boring part of the 
project. 


### Different Projects


<CardGrid stagger>
	<LinkCard title="Site" icon="pen" href="/projects/site" >
		How and Why this site is set up the way it is. As well as a sometimes
		entertaining account of my personal thoughts about the state of 
		web development. 
	</LinkCard>
	<LinkCard title="Keebs" icon="laptop" href="/projects/keebs">
		My personal journey in Keyboards, Ergonomics, and the pursuit of
		what most people consider useless.
	</LinkCard>
	<LinkCard title="Config" icon="setting" href="/projects/config">
		The relatively uninteresting story of how I like to set up my
		dev config, and the various shenanigans that have to do with it.
	</LinkCard>
</CardGrid>
